# Somnio Technology Tools

A centralized repository for Somnio Software's technology department containing all tools developed to accelerate project analysis, improve code quality, and optimize development processes.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository's main objectives are:

- **Centralize tools**: Keep all analysis and development tools in one place
- **Accelerate analysis**: Provide automated tools to evaluate project health
- **Improve quality**: Establish consistent development standards and processes
- **Optimize processes**: Automate repetitive analysis and auditing tasks
- **Facilitate maintenance**: Create reusable and scalable tools

## ⚡ Getting Started

### 📦 Install the CLI

Before using any tools, install the Somnio CLI to easily install and manage AI agent skills:

```bash
dart pub global activate --source git https://github.com/somnio-software/technology-tools --git-path cli
```

### 🚀 Quick Start

For first-time users, run the guided setup wizard. It checks which AI CLIs you have installed (Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini), helps install missing ones, and lets you choose which technologies to set up:

```bash
somnio setup
```

Already have your CLIs installed? Use `init` to detect agents and install skills directly:

```bash
somnio init
```

### 📚 CLI Documentation

For detailed CLI usage, commands, and advanced options, see the [CLI README](cli/README.md).

**Available CLI Commands:**
- `somnio setup` - Full guided setup: install CLIs, select technologies, install skills
- `somnio init` - Auto-detect agents, select technologies, and install skills
- `somnio claude` - Install skills to Claude Code
- `somnio cursor` - Install commands and rule files to Cursor (IDE + Cursor CLI)
- `somnio antigravity` - Install workflows to Antigravity
- `somnio status` - Show CLI availability and installed skills status
- `somnio run <code>` - Run a health audit step-by-step from the project terminal (with per-step token usage tracking)
- `somnio quote` (or `somnio q`) - Display a random Somnio team quote
- `somnio update` - Update CLI and reinstall skills
- `somnio add` - Add new technology skill bundles

### 🏃 Running Audits from the Terminal

Use `somnio run` from the target project's root to execute a full health audit. The CLI handles setup steps (tool installation, version alignment, test coverage) directly via pre-flight, then delegates analysis steps to an AI CLI (Claude or Gemini) in fresh contexts.

```bash
# From a Flutter project root
somnio run fh

# From a NestJS project root
somnio run nh
```

| Code | Audit |
|------|-------|
| `fh` | Flutter Project Health Audit |
| `nh` | NestJS Project Health Audit |

You can specify a model with `--model` (`-m`) or select one interactively. Each CLI has a sensible default: **haiku** for Claude and **gemini-3-flash** for Gemini.

```bash
somnio run fh --model opus          # Use a specific Claude model
somnio run nh --agent gemini -m gemini-3-pro  # Gemini with a specific model
```

Artifacts are saved to `./reports/.artifacts/` and the final report to `./reports/`. See the [CLI README](cli/README.md) for all flags (`--agent`, `--model`, `--skip-validation`, `--no-preflight`).

## 🛠️ Available Tools

This repository contains technology-specific auditing and analysis tools organized by technology stack:

- `prompts/` - AI prompts for enhanced analysis
- `README.md` - Tool-specific documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Flutter projects

Navigate to the Flutter plans directory and follow the instructions in the Flutter README:

```bash
cd flutter-plans/
# See flutter-plans/README.md for detailed instructions
```

### For NestJS projects

Navigate to the NestJS plans directory and check the current status:

```bash
cd nestjs-plans/
