# Somnio Technology Tools

A centralized repository for Somnio Software's technology department containing all tools developed to accelerate project analysis, improve code quality, and optimize development processes.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository's main objectives are:

- **Centralize tools**: Keep all analysis and development tools in one place
- **Accelerate analysis**: Provide automated tools to evaluate project health
- **Improve quality**: Establish consistent development standards and processes
- **Optimize processes**: Automate repetitive analysis and auditing tasks
- **Facilitate maintenance**: Create reusable and scalable tools

## ⚡ Getting Started

### 📦 Install the CLI

Before using any tools, install the Somnio CLI to easily install and manage AI agent skills:

```bash
dart pub global activate --source git https://github.com/somnio-software/technology-tools --git-path cli
```

### 🚀 Quick Start

For first-time users, run the guided setup wizard. It checks which AI CLIs you have installed (Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini), helps install missing ones, and lets you choose which technologies to set up:

```bash
somnio setup
```

Already have your CLIs installed? Use `init` to detect agents and install skills directly:

```bash
somnio init
```

### 📚 CLI Documentation

For detailed CLI usage, commands, and advanced options, see the [CLI README](cli/README.md).

**Available CLI Commands:**
- `somnio setup` - Full guided setup: install CLIs, select technologies, install skills
- `somnio init` - Auto-detect agents, select technologies, and install skills
- `somnio claude` - Install skills to Claude Code
- `somnio cursor` - Install commands and rule files to Cursor (IDE + Cursor CLI)
- `somnio antigravity` - Install workflows to Antigravity
- `somnio status` - Show CLI availability and installed skills status
- `somnio run <code>` - Run a health or security audit step-by-step from the project terminal (with per-step token usage tracking)
- `somnio quote` (or `somnio q`) - Display a random Somnio team quote
- `somnio update` - Update CLI and reinstall skills
- `somnio add` - Add new technology skill bundles

### 🏃 Running Audits from the Terminal

Use `somnio run` from the target project's root to execute a health or security audit. The CLI handles setup steps (tool installation, version alignment, test coverage) directly via pre-flight, then delegates analysis steps to an AI CLI (Claude or Gemini) in fresh contexts.

```bash
# From a Flutter project root
somnio run fh

# From a NestJS project root
somnio run nh

# From any project root (framework-agnostic security audit)
somnio run sa
```

| Code | Audit |
|------|-------|
| `fh` | Flutter Project Health Audit |
| `nh` | NestJS Project Health Audit |
| `sa` | Security Audit (framework-agnostic) |

You can specify a model with `--model` (`-m`) or select one interactively. Each CLI has a sensible default: **haiku** for Claude and **gemini-3-flash** for Gemini.

```bash
somnio run fh --model opus          # Use a specific Claude model
somnio run nh --agent gemini -m gemini-3-pro  # Gemini with a specific model
somnio run sa                       # Security audit (auto-detects project type)
```

After a health audit completes, the CLI will ask if you want to run a security audit as well.

Artifacts are saved to `./reports/.artifacts/` and the final report to `./reports/`. See the [CLI README](cli/README.md) for all flags (`--agent`, `--model`, `--skip-validation`, `--no-preflight`).

## 🛠️ Available Tools

This repository contains technology-specific auditing and analysis tools organized by technology stack:

### Flutter Plans
Comprehensive auditing and best practices validation tools for Flutter/Dart projects.

**Location**: `flutter-plans/`

**Documentation**: See `flutter-plans/README.md` for detailed information about available Flutter tools and usage instructions.

### NestJS Plans
Auditing system for NestJS backend and cloud functions projects.

**Location**: `nestjs-plans/`

**Documentation**: See `nestjs-plans/README.md` for current status and TODO items.

### NestJS Project Health Audit
Complete auditing system for NestJS/Node.js backend projects that includes:

- **Automated analysis**: 8 analysis categories with scoring (Tech Stack, Architecture, API Design, Data Layer, Testing, Code Quality, Documentation, CI/CD)
- **Monorepo support**: Handles single-app and monorepo structures (nx, turborepo, lerna, custom)
- **Standardized reports**: 15-section format ready for Google Docs
- **API design analysis**: REST/GraphQL validation, DTOs, OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Test coverage**: Execution, aggregation, and 70% minimum threshold validation
- **ChatGPT integration**: Specialized prompt for generating executive summaries

**Location**: `nestjs-plans/nestjs_project_health_audit/`

**Documentation**: See `nestjs-plans/nestjs_project_health_audit/README.md` for detailed instructions.

### Security Audit
Standalone, framework-agnostic security audit that detects the project type at runtime and adapts checks accordingly. Can be run independently or after a health audit.

- **Framework-agnostic**: Auto-detects Flutter, NestJS, Node.js, Go, Rust, Python, or generic projects
- **Sensitive file analysis**: Scans for exposed credentials, API keys, keystores, and checks .gitignore coverage
- **Source code secret scanning**: Detects hardcoded secrets, tokens, passwords, and cloud credentials in source code
- **Dependency vulnerability audit**: Runs native package manager scans (`npm audit`, `pub outdated`, `pip audit`, `cargo audit`, etc.)
- **Gemini AI analysis (optional)**: Leverages Gemini CLI with the security extension for advanced vulnerability detection - works with API key or Google subscription
- **Severity-classified reports**: Findings categorized as HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW with a remediation priority matrix

**Location**: `security-plans/security_audit/`

**CLI command**: `somnio run sa`

**IDE skill**: `/somnio-sa`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Flutter projects

Navigate to the Flutter plans directory and follow the instructions in the Flutter README:

```bash
cd flutter-plans/
# See flutter-plans/README.md for detailed instructions
```

### For NestJS projects

Navigate to the NestJS plans directory and check the current status:

```bash
cd nestjs-plans/
# See nestjs-plans/README.md for current status and TODO items
```

### For NestJS Health Audit
```bash
# Navigate to the specific tool
cd nestjs-plans/nestjs_project_health_audit/

# Follow instructions in the specific README
# See nestjs-plans/nestjs_project_health_audit/README.md
```

### For Security Audits

Run the standalone security audit from any project root. It auto-detects the project type:

```bash
# Via CLI (from the target project root)
somnio run sa

# Via IDE skill
/somnio-sa
```

The security audit can also be triggered after completing a health audit - the CLI will prompt you automatically.

To use the optional Gemini AI analysis, either set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your environment or sign in with `gemini auth login` (Google One AI Premium subscription).
