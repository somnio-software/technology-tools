# Somnio Technology Tools

A centralized repository for Somnio Software's technology department containing all tools developed to accelerate project analysis, improve code quality, and optimize development processes.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository's main objectives are:

- **Centralize tools**: Keep all analysis and development tools in one place
- **Accelerate analysis**: Provide automated tools to evaluate project health
- **Improve quality**: Establish consistent development standards and processes
- **Optimize processes**: Automate repetitive analysis and auditing tasks
- **Facilitate maintenance**: Create reusable and scalable tools

## ⚡ Getting Started

### 📦 Install the CLI

Before using any tools, install the Somnio CLI to easily install and manage AI agent skills:

```bash
dart pub global activate --source git https://github.com/somnio-software/technology-tools --git-path cli
```

### 🚀 Quick Start

For first-time users, run the guided setup wizard. It checks which AI CLIs you have installed, helps install missing ones, and lets you choose which technologies to set up:

```bash
somnio setup
```

Already have your CLIs installed? Skip the CLI installation step:

```bash
somnio setup --skip-cli
```

### 🤖 Supported Agents

Somnio supports **12 CLI agents** for running audits and **5 IDE-only agents** for skill installation — all driven by a single agent registry.

**CLI agents** (for `somnio run`): Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex, Augment Code, Amp, Aider, Cline, OpenCode, CodeBuddy, Qwen

**IDE-only agents** (for `somnio install`): GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Roo Code, Kilo Code, Amazon Q

Install skills to any agent:

```bash
somnio install --agent claude      # Install to Claude Code
somnio install --agent copilot     # Install to GitHub Copilot
somnio install --agent windsurf    # Install to Windsurf
somnio install --all               # Install to all detected agents
```

### 📚 CLI Documentation

For detailed CLI usage, commands, and advanced options, see the [CLI README](cli/README.md).

**Available CLI Commands:**
- `somnio setup` — Full guided setup: install CLIs, detect agents, install skills
- `somnio setup --skip-cli` — Skip CLI installation, just detect agents and install skills
- `somnio install --agent <id>` — Install skills to a specific agent
- `somnio install --all` — Install to all detected agents
- `somnio run <code>` — Run a health or security audit step-by-step
- `somnio status` — Show CLI availability and installed skills
- `somnio update` — Update CLI and reinstall skills
- `somnio uninstall` — Remove all installed skills (with confirmation)
- `somnio add <tech>` — Add new technology skill bundles
- `somnio workflow plan <name>` — Create a custom workflow via AI-guided planning
- `somnio workflow run <name>` — Execute a workflow step by step
- `somnio workflow config <name>` — Configure per-step model assignments
- `somnio workflow list` — List all available workflows
- `somnio -q <command>` — Suppress the banner on any command

### 🏃 Running Audits from the Terminal

Use `somnio run` from the target project's root to execute a health or security audit. The CLI handles setup steps (tool installation, version alignment, test coverage) directly via pre-flight, then delegates analysis steps to an AI CLI in fresh contexts.

```bash
# From a Flutter project root
somnio run fh

# From a NestJS project root
somnio run nh

# From any project root (framework-agnostic security audit)
somnio run sa
```

| Code | Audit |
|------|-------|
| `fh` | Flutter Project Health Audit |
| `nh` | NestJS Project Health Audit |
| `sa` | Security Audit (framework-agnostic) |

You can specify an agent and model explicitly, or let the CLI auto-detect and prompt interactively:

```bash
somnio run fh --agent claude --model opus
somnio run nh --agent gemini -m gemini-3-pro
somnio run fh --agent codex             # Use OpenAI Codex CLI
somnio run sa                           # Auto-detect agent, interactive model
```

After a health audit completes, the CLI will ask if you want to run a security audit as well.

Artifacts are saved to `./reports/.artifacts/` and the final report to `./reports/`. See the [CLI README](cli/README.md) for all flags (`--agent`, `--model`, `--skip-validation`, `--no-preflight`).

## 🛠️ Available Tools

This repository contains technology-specific auditing and analysis tools organized by technology stack:

### Flutter Plans
Comprehensive auditing and best practices validation tools for Flutter/Dart projects.

**Location**: `flutter-plans/`

**Documentation**: See `flutter-plans/README.md` for detailed information about available Flutter tools and usage instructions.

### NestJS Plans
Auditing system for NestJS backend and cloud functions projects.

**Location**: `nestjs-plans/`

**Documentation**: See `nestjs-plans/README.md` for current status and TODO items.

### NestJS Project Health Audit
Complete auditing system for NestJS/Node.js backend projects that includes:

- **Automated analysis**: 8 analysis categories with scoring (Tech Stack, Architecture, API Design, Data Layer, Testing, Code Quality, Documentation, CI/CD)
- **Monorepo support**: Handles single-app and monorepo structures (nx, turborepo, lerna, custom)
- **Standardized reports**: 15-section format ready for Google Docs
- **API design analysis**: REST/GraphQL validation, DTOs, OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Test coverage**: Execution, aggregation, and 70% minimum threshold validation
- **ChatGPT integration**: Specialized prompt for generating executive summaries

**Location**: `nestjs-plans/nestjs_project_health_audit/`

**Documentation**: See `nestjs-plans/nestjs_project_health_audit/README.md` for detailed instructions.

### Security Audit
Standalone, framework-agnostic security audit that detects the project type at runtime and adapts checks accordingly. Can be run independently or after a health audit.

- **Framework-agnostic**: Auto-detects Flutter, NestJS, Node.js, Go, Rust, Python, or generic projects
- **Sensitive file analysis**: Scans for exposed credentials, API keys, keystores, and checks .gitignore coverage
- **Source code secret scanning**: Detects hardcoded secrets, tokens, passwords, and cloud credentials in source code
- **Dependency vulnerability audit**: Runs native package manager scans (`npm audit`, `pub outdated`, `pip audit`, `cargo audit`, etc.)
- **Gemini AI analysis (optional)**: Leverages Gemini CLI with the security extension for advanced vulnerability detection - works with API key or Google subscription
- **Severity-classified reports**: Findings categorized as HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW with a remediation priority matrix

**Location**: `security-plans/security_audit/`

**Documentation**: See `security-plans/README.md` for detailed information about available security tools and usage instructions.

**CLI command**: `somnio run sa`

**IDE skill**: `/somnio-sa`

### Custom Workflows

Create your own repeatable, multi-step task pipelines where each step can use a different AI model. The orchestrator stays context-light, spawning a fresh process or subagent per step.

```bash
# Create a workflow (AI helps you design the steps)
somnio workflow plan dependency-cleanup

# Configure which model each step uses
somnio workflow config dependency-cleanup

# Run it — each step executes with its assigned model
somnio workflow run dependency-cleanup
```

Steps are tagged as `research` (haiku), `planning` (opus), or `execution` (sonnet) — defaults you can override per-role or per-step. Workflows support progress tracking, resume on failure, and can live at project level (`.somnio/workflows/`) or globally (`~/.somnio/workflows/`).

Claude Code users can also use the `/workflow:plan` and `/workflow:run` skills directly from a Claude Code session.

**Location**: `workflow-skills/`

**Documentation**: See [workflow-skills/README.md](workflow-skills/README.md) for file formats, full examples, and detailed usage.
