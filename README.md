# Somnio Technology Tools

A centralized repository for Somnio Software's technology department containing all tools developed to accelerate project analysis, improve code quality, and optimize development processes.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository's main objectives are:

- **Centralize tools**: Keep all analysis and development tools in one place
- **Accelerate analysis**: Provide automated tools to evaluate project health
- **Improve quality**: Establish consistent development standards and processes
- **Optimize processes**: Automate repetitive analysis and auditing tasks
- **Facilitate maintenance**: Create reusable and scalable tools

## 🛠️ Available Tools

This repository contains technology-specific auditing and analysis tools organized by technology stack:

### Flutter Plans
Comprehensive auditing and best practices validation tools for Flutter/Dart projects.

**Location**: `flutter-plans/`

**Documentation**: See `flutter-plans/README.md` for detailed information about available Flutter tools and usage instructions.

### NestJS Plans
Auditing system for NestJS backend and cloud functions projects.

**Location**: `nestjs-plans/`

**Documentation**: See `nestjs-plans/README.md` for current status and TODO items.

### NestJS Project Health Audit
Complete auditing system for NestJS/Node.js backend projects that includes:

- **Automated analysis**: 9 analysis categories with scoring (Tech Stack, Architecture, API Design, Data Layer, Testing, Code Quality, Security, Documentation, CI/CD)
- **Monorepo support**: Handles single-app and monorepo structures (nx, turborepo, lerna, custom)
- **Standardized reports**: 16-section format ready for Google Docs
- **API design analysis**: REST/GraphQL validation, DTOs, OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Security analysis**: Authentication/authorization patterns, OWASP Top 10 compliance
- **Test coverage**: Execution, aggregation, and 70% minimum threshold validation
- **ChatGPT integration**: Specialized prompt for generating executive summaries

**Location**: `nestjs-plans/nestjs_project_health_audit/`

**Documentation**: See `nestjs-plans/nestjs_project_health_audit/README.md` for detailed instructions.

Each tool directory contains:
- `cursor_rules/` - Analysis rules (YAML files)
- `plan/` - Execution plans
- `prompts/` - AI prompts for enhanced analysis
- `README.md` - Tool-specific documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Flutter projects

Navigate to the Flutter plans directory and follow the instructions in the Flutter README:

```bash
cd flutter-plans/
# See flutter-plans/README.md for detailed instructions
```

### For NestJS projects

Navigate to the NestJS plans directory and check the current status:

```bash
cd nestjs-plans/
# See nestjs-plans/README.md for current status and TODO items
```

### For NestJS Health Audit
```bash
# Navigate to the specific tool
cd nestjs-plans/nestjs_project_health_audit/

# Follow instructions in the specific README
# See nestjs-plans/nestjs_project_health_audit/README.md
```

### For new tools

1. Create new folder with descriptive name (e.g., `react/`, `nodejs/`)
2. Include complete documentation in README.md within the folder
3. Update this main README with the new tool category

## 🔧 Development

### Adding new tools

1. Create folder with descriptive name
2. Include complete documentation in README.md within the folder
3. Update this main README with the new tool category
4. Follow established documentation standards

### Documentation standards

- Complete README.md in each technology folder
- Clear usage instructions
- Practical examples
- Documented file structure
- Tool-specific details should be in the technology folder's README

### Code Quality Standards

All YAML rule files follow strict formatting standards:
- **Line Length**: Maximum 80 characters per line
- **Formatting**: Commands split using shell continuation (`\`)
- **Descriptions**: Use folded scalar format (`>`) for multi-line text
- **Readability**: Optimized for maintainability and consistency

### Validation & Testing

The repository includes validation scripts to ensure code quality:
- **Plan Simulation**: Validates all plans and their referenced rules
- **YAML Validation**: Checks syntax and structure of all YAML files
- **Reference Verification**: Ensures all rule references are valid

Run validation:
```bash
./simulate_plans.sh  # Simulates all plans and validates rules
```
