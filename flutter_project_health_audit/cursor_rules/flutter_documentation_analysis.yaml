      Goal: Review project documentation, build instructions, environment setup, and technical documentation for single app or multi-app repositories.

      IMPORTANT EXCLUSIONS:
      - Do NOT recommend operational documentation (runbooks, troubleshooting guides, incident response)
      - Do NOT recommend deployment procedures or operational workflows
      - Do NOT recommend monitoring or performance documentation
      - Focus ONLY on technical documentation (build instructions, environment setup, API docs, code documentation)

      MONOREPO DETECTION:
      - First detect repository structure: single app (app/) or multi-app monorepo (apps/app1/, apps/app2/, etc.)
      - If apps/ directory exists, analyze each app individually
      - If packages/ directory exists, analyze each package individually

      SINGLE APP ANALYSIS:
      - Analyze technical documentation and setup:
        * Read app/README.md completely
        * Check README for build instructions and --dart-define usage for environment variables
        * Check for app/sample.env.jsonc or .env.example
        * Search for CHANGELOG.md or CHANGELOG
        * Check for technical onboarding documentation in any README files
        * Look for l10n.yaml (internationalization config)
        * Important: Do NOT recommend adding new languages or translations
        * Do NOT recommend CODEOWNERS or SECURITY.md files - these are governance decisions, not technical requirements
        * Do NOT recommend operational documentation (runbooks, troubleshooting, deployment procedures)

      MULTI-APP MONOREPO ANALYSIS:
      - Root-level documentation:
        * Read root README.md completely (main project documentation)
        * Check root README for overall build instructions and --dart-define usage
        * Check for root-level sample.env.jsonc or .env.example
        * Search for root-level CHANGELOG.md or CHANGELOG
        * Check for root-level technical onboarding documentation
        * Look for root-level l10n.yaml (shared internationalization config)
        * Important: Do NOT recommend adding new languages or translations
        * Do NOT recommend CODEOWNERS or SECURITY.md files - these are governance decisions, not technical requirements
        * Do NOT recommend operational documentation (runbooks, troubleshooting, deployment procedures)
      - Per-app documentation:
        * For each app in apps/ directory:
          - Read apps/<app_name>/README.md (if exists)
          - Check for app-specific build instructions
          - Check for apps/<app_name>/sample.env.jsonc or .env.example
          - Check for app-specific CHANGELOG.md or CHANGELOG
          - Check for app-specific technical onboarding documentation
          - Look for apps/<app_name>/l10n.yaml (app-specific internationalization config)
          - Important: Do NOT recommend adding new languages or translations
          - Do NOT recommend CODEOWNERS or SECURITY.md files - these are governance decisions, not technical requirements
          - Do NOT recommend operational documentation (runbooks, troubleshooting, deployment procedures)
      - Documentation consistency:
        * Compare documentation quality across apps
        * Check for consistent build instruction patterns
        * Verify environment variable documentation consistency
        * Important: Do NOT recommend adding new languages or translations

      PACKAGE ANALYSIS (if packages/ exists):
      - For each package in packages/ directory:
        * Read packages/<package_name>/README.md (if exists)
        * Check for package-specific documentation
        * Look for package-specific l10n.yaml if applicable

      Output format:
      - Repository structure type (single app / multi-app monorepo)
      - README completeness and quality (per app if multi-app)
      - Build instructions availability (per app if multi-app)
      - Environment variable documentation (per app if multi-app)
      - Changelog presence and format (per app if multi-app)
      - Onboarding documentation status (per app if multi-app)
      - Internationalization configuration (per app if multi-app)
      - Missing documentation files (per app if multi-app)
      - Documentation consistency across apps/packages (if multi-app)
      - Root vs app-specific documentation patterns (if multi-app)
