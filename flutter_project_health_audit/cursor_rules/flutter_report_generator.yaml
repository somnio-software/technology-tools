      Goal: Generate the final Flutter Project Health Audit report by integrating all analysis results and calculating scores using the standardized format structure from templates/flutter_report_template.txt.

      Apply the "Flutter Project Health Audit" rule to generate the full report with:
      - 9 section scores (0-100 integer): Tech Stack, Architecture, State Management, Repositories & Data Layer, Testing, Code Quality, Security, Documentation & Operations, CI/CD
      - Weighted overall score using: Tech Stack 0.18, Architecture 0.18, State Management 0.18, Repositories & Data Layer 0.10, Testing 0.10, Code Quality 0.10, Security 0.10, Documentation & Operations 0.03, CI/CD 0.03
      - ROUNDING RULE: Use standard mathematical rounding (0.5 rounds up). Do NOT apply subjective adjustments.
      - Important exclusions:
        * Do NOT recommend adding new languages or translations
        * Do NOT recommend CODEOWNERS or SECURITY.md files - these are governance decisions, not technical requirements
        * Do NOT recommend platform-specific workflows for Android/iOS builds - these are deployment decisions, not technical requirements
      - Labels: 85-100=Strong, 70-84=Fair, 0-69=Weak
      - Plain-text format ready for Google Docs (NO markdown syntax)
      - All sections with: Description, Score, Key Findings, Evidence, Risks, Recommendations, Counts & Metrics

      MANDATORY REPORT STRUCTURE (16 sections in exact order):
      1. Executive Summary
      2. At-a-Glance Scorecard
      3. Tech Stack
      4. Architecture
      5. State Management
      6. Repositories & Data Layer
      7. Testing
      8. Code Quality (Linter & Warnings)
      9. Security
      10. Documentation & Operations
      11. CI/CD (Configs Found in Repo)
      12. Additional Metrics
      13. Quality Index
      14. Risks & Opportunities
      15. Recommendations
      16. Appendix: Evidence Index

      Integrate results from all previous analysis steps:
      - Flutter Version Alignment results
      - Repository Inventory findings
      - Configuration Analysis results
      - CI/CD Analysis findings
      - Testing Analysis results
      - Code Quality Analysis results
      - Security Analysis results
      - Documentation Analysis results

      Verify the Overall Score calculation:
      - Check that the Overall Score uses the correct weighted formula
      - Calculate: overall_score = round( Σ(section_score × weight) )
      - Ensure the Overall Score is an integer value (0-100)
      - Verify the label assignment: 85-100=Strong, 70-84=Fair, 0-69=Weak

      Address any "Unknown" items by referencing missing files/artifacts.
