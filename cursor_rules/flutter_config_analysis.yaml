      Goal: Read and analyze Flutter/Dart configuration files for single app or multi-app repositories.

      MONOREPO DETECTION:
      - First detect repository structure: single app (app/) or multi-app monorepo (apps/app1/, apps/app2/, etc.)
      - If apps/ directory exists, analyze each app individually
      - If packages/ directory exists, analyze each package individually

      SINGLE APP ANALYSIS:
      - Read completely and analyze:
        * app/pubspec.yaml (Flutter version, Dart SDK, dependencies, dev_dependencies, especially very_good_analysis, flutter_localizations)
        * app/analysis_options.yaml (includes, exclusions, rule overrides)
        * Check for .fvm/fvm_config.json or .fvmrc (Flutter version management)
        * Check for i18n configuration: app/l10n.yaml, app/lib/l10n/*.arb files
        * Verify flutter_localizations dependency in pubspec.yaml

      MULTI-APP MONOREPO ANALYSIS:
      - For each app in apps/ directory:
        * Read apps/<app_name>/pubspec.yaml (Flutter version, Dart SDK, dependencies, dev_dependencies, especially very_good_analysis, flutter_localizations)
        * Read apps/<app_name>/analysis_options.yaml (includes, exclusions, rule overrides)
        * Check for app-specific .fvm/fvm_config.json or .fvmrc in apps/<app_name>/
        * Check for app-specific i18n configuration: apps/<app_name>/l10n.yaml, apps/<app_name>/lib/l10n/*.arb files
        * Verify flutter_localizations dependency in each app's pubspec.yaml
        * Check for root-level .fvm/fvm_config.json or .fvmrc (shared across apps)
        * Check for root-level i18n configuration: l10n.yaml, lib/l10n/*.arb files
      - Compare configurations across apps:
        * Flutter/Dart version consistency
        * Dependency version alignment
        * Analysis options consistency
        * i18n configuration consistency

      PACKAGE ANALYSIS (if packages/ exists):
      - For each package in packages/ directory:
        * Read packages/<package_name>/pubspec.yaml (Flutter version, Dart SDK, dependencies, dev_dependencies)
        * Read packages/<package_name>/analysis_options.yaml (includes, exclusions, rule overrides)
        * Check for package-specific .fvm/fvm_config.json or .fvmrc
        * Check for package-specific i18n configuration if applicable

      Output format:
      - Repository structure type (single app / multi-app monorepo)
      - Extract exact Flutter and Dart SDK versions (per app if multi-app)
      - List all dependencies and dev_dependencies (per app if multi-app)
      - Note very_good_analysis version if present (per app if multi-app)
      - Document analysis_options.yaml configuration (per app/package if applicable)
      - Report internationalization setup status (per app if multi-app)
      - Important: Do NOT recommend adding new languages or translations
      - Do NOT recommend CODEOWNERS or SECURITY.md files - these are governance decisions, not technical requirements
      - Identify any missing configuration files (per app if multi-app)
      - Version consistency across apps/packages (if multi-app)
      - Configuration inheritance patterns (if multi-app)
