      Goal: Detect repository structure, platform folders, monorepo packages, and feature organization for single app or multi-app repositories.

      MONOREPO DETECTION:
      - First detect repository structure: single app (app/) or multi-app monorepo (apps/app1/, apps/app2/, etc.)
      - If apps/ directory exists, analyze each app individually
      - If packages/ directory exists, analyze each package individually

      SINGLE APP INVENTORY:
      - Platform folders present in app/ (android/, ios/, web/, macos/, windows/, linux/)
      - All packages in app/packages/ directory (list names)
      - All feature folders in app/lib/ (count directories, exclude gen/, l10n/, utils/, extensions/, constants/)
      - Presence of .fvm/ directory or .fvm/fvm_config.json

      MULTI-APP MONOREPO INVENTORY:
      - Root-level structure:
        * Overall repository structure type (multi-app monorepo)
        * Root-level packages/ directory (if exists)
        * Root-level .fvm/ directory or .fvm/fvm_config.json
        * Root-level feature folders (if any)
      - Per-app inventory:
        * For each app in apps/ directory:
          - Platform folders present in apps/<app_name>/ (android/, ios/, web/, macos/, windows/, linux/)
          - All packages in apps/<app_name>/packages/ directory (list names)
          - All feature folders in apps/<app_name>/lib/ (count directories, exclude gen/, l10n/, utils/, extensions/, constants/)
          - Presence of apps/<app_name>/.fvm/ directory or apps/<app_name>/.fvm/fvm_config.json
      - Cross-app analysis:
        * Compare platform support across apps
        * Compare package usage across apps
        * Compare feature organization across apps
        * Identify shared vs app-specific packages
        * Identify shared vs app-specific features

      PACKAGE ANALYSIS (if packages/ exists):
      - For each package in packages/ directory:
        * Package name and purpose
        * Platform folders present in packages/<package_name>/ (if applicable)
        * Feature folders in packages/<package_name>/lib/ (if applicable)
        * Package-specific .fvm/ configuration (if applicable)

      Output format:
      - Repository structure type (single app / multi-app monorepo)
      - Provide exact counts for each category (per app if multi-app)
      - List specific package names found (per app if multi-app)
      - Note any missing expected directories (per app if multi-app)
      - Document the overall repository structure type
      - Cross-app consistency analysis (if multi-app)
      - Shared vs app-specific resources breakdown (if multi-app)
      - Platform support matrix across apps (if multi-app)
      - Package usage patterns across apps (if multi-app)
