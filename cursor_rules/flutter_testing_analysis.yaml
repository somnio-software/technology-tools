    description: Find and classify all test files, identify coverage configuration and test types for Flutter projects (single app or multi-app monorepos).

      Goal: Find and classify all test files, identify coverage configuration and test types for single app or multi-app repositories.

      MONOREPO DETECTION:
      - First detect repository structure: single app (app/) or multi-app monorepo (apps/app1/, apps/app2/, etc.)
      - If apps/ directory exists, analyze each app individually
      - If packages/ directory exists, analyze each package individually

      SINGLE APP TESTING ANALYSIS:
      - Search and classify testing setup:
        * Find all *_test.dart files in app/test/ and app/packages/*/test/
        * Count total test files
        * Classify by type based on imports: bloc_test (uses bloc_test package), widget tests (uses testWidgets), unit tests (other)
        * Search workflows for coverage enforcement (lcov, coverage threshold, --coverage flag)
        * Look for test/ directory structure in main app and each package
        * Integrate coverage results from Flutter Test Coverage Runner
        * Include coverage percentage and threshold verification

      MULTI-APP MONOREPO TESTING ANALYSIS:
      - Root-level testing configuration:
        * Search for root-level test configurations
        * Check for shared testing utilities or packages
        * Look for root-level coverage configuration
      - Per-app testing analysis:
        * For each app in apps/ directory:
          - Find all *_test.dart files in apps/<app_name>/test/ and apps/<app_name>/packages/*/test/
          - Count total test files per app
          - Classify by type based on imports: bloc_test (uses bloc_test package), widget tests (uses testWidgets), unit tests (other)
          - Look for test/ directory structure in each app
          - Check for app-specific coverage configuration
          - Integrate coverage results from Flutter Test Coverage Runner per app
          - Include coverage percentage and threshold verification per app
      - Cross-app testing consistency:
        * Compare testing patterns across apps
        * Verify consistent test structure
        * Check for shared vs app-specific test utilities
      - Workflow testing analysis:
        * Search workflows for app-specific testing:
          - Look for workflows that test specific apps (e.g., "cd apps/app1 && flutter test")
          - Check for matrix strategies that test multiple apps
          - Verify each app has proper test execution
        * Search workflows for coverage enforcement (lcov, coverage threshold, --coverage flag)
        * Check for per-app coverage collection

      PACKAGE TESTING ANALYSIS (if packages/ exists):
      - For each package in packages/ directory:
        * Find all *_test.dart files in packages/<package_name>/test/
        * Count total test files per package
        * Classify by type based on imports
        * Look for package-specific test configurations
        * Check for package-specific coverage configuration

      COVERAGE ANALYSIS:
      - Single app coverage:
        * Look for coverage/lcov.info
        * Check for coverage/html/ directory (genhtml reports)
        * Verify coverage thresholds in workflows
      - Multi-app coverage:
        * Look for per-app coverage: coverage/app1/lcov.info, coverage/app2/lcov.info
        * Check for per-app HTML reports: coverage/app1/html/, coverage/app2/html/
        * Verify per-app coverage thresholds
        * Check for aggregated coverage reports
        * Verify coverage execution per app

      Output format:
      - Repository structure type (single app / multi-app monorepo)
      - Total count of test files (per app if multi-app)
      - Breakdown by test type (unit, widget, bloc) (per app if multi-app)
      - Coverage configuration found in workflows (per app if multi-app)
      - Test directory structure analysis (per app if multi-app)
      - Coverage percentage and threshold status (per app if multi-app)
      - Any missing test configurations (per app if multi-app)
      - Testing consistency across apps/packages (if multi-app)
      - Cross-app testing patterns and shared utilities (if multi-app)
      - Per-app vs aggregated coverage analysis (if multi-app)
