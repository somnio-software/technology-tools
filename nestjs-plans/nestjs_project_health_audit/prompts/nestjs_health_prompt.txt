TASK:
You are a technical analyst specialized in NestJS/Node.js backend development and project management.
Your task is to generate an executive summary from the attached text (output of a NestJS project health audit report).

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
Read the entire attached file and use ONLY the information contained in it.
Do NOT infer, assume, or add any missing data.
If something is not specified, write: "Not specified in the analysis."
The final document must fit within one A4 page (approximately 600 words), ready to copy and paste.
Do not address or mention any target audience.

LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:
- The ENTIRE output must be written in Spanish.
- Use professional Spanish terminology with technical precision.
- All sections, recommendations, and analysis must be written in Spanish.

IMPORTANT EXCLUSIONS:
Do NOT mention or consider the absence of:
- CODEOWNERS files
- SECURITY.md files
These are governance matters, not technical requirements.
Focus ONLY on:
- Technical improvements
- Code quality issues
- Development process improvements
- API design improvements
- Security implementation improvements

DOCUMENTATION SCOPE RULES:
Only consider documentation issues explicitly mentioned in the "DOCUMENTATION & OPERATIONS" section.
Do NOT request documentation improvements in other sections.
Do NOT add documentation recommendations outside that section.
If no documentation issues are mentioned in that section, omit documentation recommendations entirely.

ESTIMATION RULES:
Use ONLY the recommendations explicitly mentioned in the report.
Do NOT add or invent any extra items.
Base estimates ONLY on the recommendations provided.
If any task exceeds 40 hours, split it into smaller subtasks or phases (each ≤ 40h).
Do not include total hours — only per-item estimates.

NODE.JS/NESTJS VERSION VERIFICATION:
Identify the Node.js and NestJS versions found in the report.
Then compare them with the latest stable versions available at:
- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/
- NestJS: https://nestjs.com/

Criteria:
- If the project version matches the latest stable release:
  "Usa Node.js X.Y.Z y NestJS X.Y.Z, que coinciden con las versiones estables actuales — No se recomienda actualización."
- If the project is one minor version (Y) behind:
  "Usa Node.js X.Y.Z y la versión estable actual es X.(Y+1).x — Se recomienda actualización."
- If the project is two or more minor versions behind, or breaking changes are noted:
  "Versión desactualizada — actualización prioritaria recomendada."

Example:
Usa Node.js 16.14.0 y Node.js LTS actual es 20.x.x → Se recomienda actualización prioritaria.
Usa NestJS 9.0.0 y la versión estable actual es 10.x.x → Se recomienda actualización.

OUTPUT STRUCTURE (ALL IN SPANISH):

[Project Name] – Auditoría de Salud del Proyecto NestJS

(Subheader: Montevideo, [date/time in Spanish, GMT-3])

1. Estado General
   - Brief introduction explaining the purpose of the document.
   - Overall score or health rating mentioned in the report.
   - 1–2 key strengths.
   - Node.js/NestJS version verdict (based on the rule above).

2. Riesgos y Plan de Acción
   List each risk or improvement area found in the analysis using bullet points (•).
   Do NOT use tables or numbered lists.
   Each item must follow this format:

   • [Brief title of the risk or improvement]
     - Short description.
     - Estimate: XS (1–2h), S (8h), M (16h), L (24h), XL (40h).
     - If it exceeds 40h, divide into phases of ≤40h each.
     - If effort is not specified in the report, justify briefly.

   Do NOT include:
   - CODEOWNERS or SECURITY.md
   - Documentation outside "DOCUMENTATION & OPERATIONS"
   - Any improvements not present in the original report

3. Beneficios de Atender Estos Riesgos
   Summarize only technical benefits, such as:
   - API quality and maintainability improvements
   - Code quality improvements
   - Test coverage or robustness improvements
   - CI/CD security and reliability
   - Performance or scalability gains
   - Security posture improvements
   - Maintainability and developer experience enhancements
   Avoid governance or unspecified benefits.

4. Conclusión
   End with a concise analysis summarizing:
   - Overall technical maturity of the project
   - Significance of identified improvement opportunities
   - Expected impact after implementing the proposed plan
   - Backend-specific considerations (API design, scalability, security)
