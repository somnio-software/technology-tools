# NestJS Tools

Comprehensive auditing and analysis tools for NestJS/Node.js projects
developed by Somnio Software to accelerate project analysis, improve code
quality, and optimize development processes.

## 🎯 Purpose

This directory contains NestJS-specific tools designed to:

- **Evaluate project health**: Automated analysis of NestJS/Node.js project
  infrastructure and code quality
- **Enforce best practices**: Validate code against established development
  standards
- **Improve quality**: Identify areas for improvement in architecture,
  testing, and code standards
- **Generate reports**: Create standardized, actionable reports for project
  stakeholders

## 🛠️ Available Tools

### NestJS Project Health Audit

Complete auditing system for NestJS/Node.js backend projects that includes:

- **Automated analysis**: 9 analysis categories with scoring (Tech Stack,
  Architecture, API Design, Data Layer, Testing, Code Quality, Security,
  Documentation, CI/CD)
- **Monorepo support**: Handles single-app and monorepo structures (nx,
  turborepo, lerna, custom)
- **Standardized reports**: 16-section format ready for Google Docs
- **API design analysis**: REST/GraphQL validation, DTOs, OpenAPI/Swagger
  documentation
- **Security analysis**: Authentication/authorization patterns, OWASP Top 10
  compliance
- **Test coverage**: Execution, aggregation, and 70% minimum threshold
  validation
- **ChatGPT integration**: Specialized prompt for generating executive
  summaries

**Location**: `nestjs_project_health_audit/`

**Documentation**: See `nestjs_project_health_audit/README.md` for detailed
instructions.

### NestJS Best Practices Check

Specialized tool for validating code quality and adherence to specific
development standards:

- **Micro-level analysis**: Evaluation of testing quality, architecture
  compliance, and code standards
- **Live Standards Validation**: Validates code against live `.mdc`
  standards from GitHub
- **Report Template**: Standardized plain-text reporting
- **Modular Rules**: Independent analysis rules for Testing, Architecture,
  Code Standards, DTO Validation, and Error Handling

**Location**: `nestjs_best_practices_check/`

**Documentation**: See `nestjs_best_practices_check/README.md` for detailed
instructions.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Health Audit Only (Macro-level)

```bash
# Navigate to the health audit tool
cd nestjs_project_health_audit/

# Execute the plan
@nestjs-health.plan.md

# See nestjs_project_health_audit/README.md for detailed instructions
```

### Option 2: Combined Audit (Macro + Micro-level)

```bash
# Step 1: Execute Health Audit
@nestjs_project_health_audit/plan/nestjs-health.plan.md

# Step 2: Execute Best Practices Check (optional)
@nestjs_best_practices_check/plan/best_practices.plan.md
```

**What You Get**:
- **Health Audit**: Infrastructure, CI/CD, security, documentation analysis
- **Best Practices Check**: Code quality, testing standards, architecture
  compliance

**Reports Generated**:
- Health Audit: `./reports/nestjs_audit.txt`
- Best Practices: Generated by the best practices generator (see plan for
  location)
