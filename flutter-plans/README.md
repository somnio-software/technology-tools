# Flutter Tools

Comprehensive auditing and analysis tools for Flutter/Dart projects developed by Somnio Software to accelerate project analysis, improve code quality, and optimize development processes.

## 🎯 Purpose

This directory contains Flutter-specific tools designed to:

- **Evaluate project health**: Automated analysis of Flutter/Dart project infrastructure and code quality
- **Enforce best practices**: Validate code against established development standards
- **Improve quality**: Identify areas for improvement in architecture, testing, and code standards
- **Generate reports**: Create standardized, actionable reports for project stakeholders

## 🛠️ Available Tools

### Flutter Project Health Audit
Complete auditing system for Flutter/Dart projects that includes:

- **Automated analysis**: 9 analysis categories with scoring
- **Multi-app support**: Handles simple and monorepo repository structures
- **Standardized reports**: 16-section format ready for Google Docs
- **CI/CD integration**: GitHub Actions workflow analysis
- **Test coverage**: Execution, aggregation, and 70% minimum threshold validation
- **ChatGPT integration**: Specialized prompt for generating executive summaries

**Location**: `flutter_project_health_audit/`

**Documentation**: See `flutter_project_health_audit/README.md` for detailed instructions.

### Flutter Best Practices Check
Specialized tool for validating code quality and adherence to specific development standards:

- **Micro-level analysis**: Evaluation of testing quality, architecture compliance, and code standards
- **Live Standards Validation**: Validates code against live `.mdc` standards from GitHub
- **Report Template**: Standardized plain-text reporting
- **Modular Rules**: Independent analysis rules for Testing, Architecture, and Code Standards

**Location**: `flutter_best_practices_check/`

**Documentation**: See `flutter_best_practices_check/README.md` for detailed instructions.

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Health Audit Only (Macro-level)
```bash
# Navigate to the health audit tool
cd flutter_project_health_audit/

# Execute the plan
@flutter-health.plan.md

# See flutter_project_health_audit/README.md for detailed instructions
```

### Option 2: Combined Audit (Macro + Micro-level)
```bash
# Step 1: Execute Health Audit
@flutter_project_health_audit/plan/flutter-health.plan.md

# Step 2: After Health Audit completes, you will be prompted to execute Best Practices Check
# The system will ask if you want to run it - you must confirm before execution
@flutter_best_practices_check/plan/best_practices.plan.md
```

**Important**: The Best Practices Check is **NEVER executed automatically**. After the Health Audit completes, you will be prompted to confirm if you want to run it.

**What You Get**:
- **Health Audit**: Infrastructure, CI/CD, security, documentation analysis
- **Best Practices Check**: Code quality, testing standards, architecture compliance (optional, user-confirmed)

**Reports Generated**:
- Health Audit: `./reports/flutter_audit.txt`
- Best Practices: Generated by the best practices generator (see plan for location)

## 📋 Prerequisites

### For Flutter Project Health Audit
- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- FVM (recommended)
- Git repository with Flutter project
- **Gemini API Key**: `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable (for security audit)

### For Flutter Best Practices Check
- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- Cursor IDE (for running rules)
- Active Internet Connection (for fetching live standards)

## 🔧 Development

### Adding new Flutter tools

1. Create new folder with descriptive name
2. Include complete documentation in README.md
3. Update this README with the new tool
4. Follow established documentation standards

### Documentation standards
- Complete README.md in each tool
- Clear usage instructions
- Practical examples
- Documented file structure

### Code Quality Standards

All YAML rule files follow strict formatting standards:
- **Line Length**: Maximum 80 characters per line
- **Formatting**: Commands split using shell continuation (`\`)
- **Descriptions**: Use folded scalar format (`>`) for multi-line text
- **Readability**: Optimized for maintainability and consistency
