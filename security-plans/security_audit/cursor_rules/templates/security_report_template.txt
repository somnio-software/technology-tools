Security Audit Report

1. Security Scoring Breakdown

Sensitive File Protection:     [Score]/100 ([Label]) - Weight: 25%
Secret Detection:              [Score]/100 ([Label]) - Weight: 30%
Dependency Security:           [Score]/100 ([Label]) - Weight: 20%
Supply Chain Integrity:        [Score]/100 ([Label]) - Weight: 10%
Security Automation & CI/CD:   [Score]/100 ([Label]) - Weight: 15%

Overall Score: [Score]/100 ([Label])

Formula: Overall = round(File Protection * 0.25 + Secret Detection * 0.30 + Dependency Security * 0.20 + Supply Chain * 0.10 + Automation * 0.15)

Security Posture: [Secure / Needs Attention / At Risk / Critical]
